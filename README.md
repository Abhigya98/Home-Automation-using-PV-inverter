# Home-Automation-using-PV-inverter
Designing a smart home automation system with load management, cost efficiency  and automatic switching mechanism from AC supply to solar energy 
Designing a level 4 IoT system with one server and two clients. Collecting sensor data of electricity consumption in a house and uploading data in real time to thinkspeak.com for actuation and analysis. The electronic components are controlled by blynk. Also providing google assistant as a mean of controlling linked gadgets.
After analysis, providing a complete user record and suggesting smart methods of curbing electricity usage like presence and temperature detection etc.

The power grid management across the world is not updated with the technology enhancement and are suffering from reliability issues. Battery powered inverters have prevailed in market for the last four decades in India.

Many situations require 24/7 uninterrupted power management. For example, Exams are a crucial time in a studentâ€™s life. With increasing use of online tests, it is essential that power be available at all times. Also in laboratories, some of the equipments used are sensitive and are affected during power failure.

*Solution*
Recent technological innovations are focused towards green globe environmental cause for the future world. This proposal aims to exploit the solar energy at institutions and address PV based charging technology, which is emerging as an alternate power, in addition with advanced controller based switching load management using a user interface app (i.e., customised selectivity of loads through app). This technology uses inverters as a voltage switching device when the grid fails.
